There are 4 NULL dereferences when running make infer and I do not know how to fix it.
I'm sorry. I tried researching ways to fix it but came short and had no idea how to do it.
 
 In order to use sequence.c, it is compiled using the makefile. The command make creates the 
 sieve.o, sequence.o, bv.o and sequence terminal file. Make clean removes the  createed files 
 Infer makes provides the user with errors and warnings. 

You can use my program by typing ./Filename and inputing -n <integer> sets the bitvector to 
that length in bits. -s prints out the primes integers and tells the user if its lucas, mersenne and 
fibonacci. -p prints out all the palindrome primes with their corresponding value. 

The output will be presented to you in gitbash.
