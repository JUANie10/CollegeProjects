Lab 5: A Gambling Game
CMPE 012 Spring 2019
Lee, Juan
-------------------------

What was your design approach?

My design approach was starting from the inside and then expanding towards the bigger subprograms. Doing this actually helped me in testing the lab because it started off with testing the find max. Noticing this, I followed the order in which the test file tested the subprograms and tried to connect the subprograms to bigger programs. I also wrote certain register address or stored values on paper in order to keep track of what in them at all times instead of trying to keep track of those values inside my head. Slug slug slug

What did you learn in this lab?

I learned how to push and pop values from the stack and also got to interact with how the registers are stored throughout all the subprograms.

Did you encounter any issues? 

I ran into a lot of address out of range issues but I quickly fixed those by looking at the code for a long period of time to catch the mistakes that I've made. 

Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?

When I was done with the lab and the interactive game worked, I was actually enjoying the lab. Knowing that I created the code and being able to play it was enjoyable. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

Clearer instructions on how the test file interacts with the actual files would've helped because even the TA were unsure of how the files actually interact with one another in the beginning. 

What resources did you use to complete this lab?

Did you work with anyone on the lab? Describe the level of collaboration.

I worked on this lab alone and did not discuss any information about the lab with my peers. I attend every lab section and asked Ta for help whenever I encountered a problem.
