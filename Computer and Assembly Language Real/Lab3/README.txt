Lab 3: MIPS!
CMPE 012 Spring 2019
Lee, Juan
-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processorâ€™s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
The registers that I used were $v0-1, $a0, and $t0-4. I used these registers to store integers in order to compare, complete arithmetic operations and print out the integers. 
The texts were either stored through comments with the use of # or I would save the strings of text using .asciiz and recall using $v0 registers.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objective of this lab was to learn the fundamentals of mips assembly language and be able to computer arithmetic operations using the MARS program in MIPS. In doing so, I was able to figure out how to make a program that calculates the factorial of a inputed integer between 0 and 10.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I had a hard time trying to start this lab. I didn't know anything about the MIPS coding assembly language and the textbook and the videos didn't really clarify the materials that I needed to use for this lab. When I figured out how MIPS works, I began to run test trials and the success of those trials felt enjoyable to me. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Better instructions and the class should teach MIPS instead of leaving the students to figure it out on their own. A lot of people had hard time trying to complete this lab because they had no idea how MIPS worked. 

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
I watched the videos on youtube that was part of the Lab and I Read the textbook for more help. I asked useful questions during my lab sections to fully grasp what we needed to do for this lab. I used google to search up how looping works in MARS. 

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
I worked on this lab alone. I didn't have any levels of collaboration except for the helps that the TA from lab gave.
