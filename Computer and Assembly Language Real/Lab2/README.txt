Lab 2: A Math Game
CMPE 012 Spring 2019
Lee, Juan
-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?

Through this lab, I learned how to implement xor, flip flops and mux in mmlogic. I also learned how to build a mux using logic gates. I was able to learn how to build full adders for addition and subtraction and how to convert twoâ€™s complement to decimal numbers using logic gates. I was able to learn how to build the adders, mux and flip flops hands compared to how we learned it through worksheets. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?

For me personally, writing down the logic operations first on paper saved me a ton of time compared to just using logic gates to figure out if something would work or not. I made truth tables and logic gate replicas to make sure the bits were what I wanted. I had a really hard time trying to figure out how to start the lab or even where to start the lab. A lot of the things that were used in this lab were mostly from external resources rather than the lab guide that was given. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

I would list step by step on what to do on the actual lab. I would also teach the students how to use mmlogic not through youtube videos. 

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)

I used google to search up how to build a mux, overflow information and flip flops. I needed to search up how to build it through logic gates to proceed with the lab. I also used the TAs for help during my lab section. They helped me understand the logic behind the circuits. 

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.

I did not work together with anybody.
