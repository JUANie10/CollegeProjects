Computer and Assembly Language Projects

Language used: MIPS

Technology used: MMLogic 

Concepts covered:

1. Truth Tables, NAND and NOR gate implementation within MMLogic

2. Learned how to implement xor, flip flops and mux in mmlogic. I also learned how to build a mux using logic gates. Built full adders for addition and subtraction and how to convert twoâ€™s complement to decimal numbers using logic gates.

3. Learned the fundamentals of mips assembly language and be able to computer arithmetic operations using the MARS program in MIPS.

4. Memory Address storage and converting decimal value to binary.

5. Pushing and poping values from the stack and interacting with how the registers are stored throughout all the subprograms.
