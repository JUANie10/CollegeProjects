If the majority of balls is red then roll dice and you win an amount equal to the sum of the dice. If the majority of balls isn't red, than you lose the sum of the dice roll. If you had to pay $2 to play this game, about how much would you expect to win (or lose)? Please round off your answer to the nearest cent."
