To play the game you need to run "python ConnectFour.py arg1 arg2" where arg1 and arg2 are one of AI, random, or human. 
ConnectFour.py takes one optional argument --time that is an integer and it is a value used to limit the amount of time in second to wait for the AI player to make a move. 
The default is 60 seconds.
