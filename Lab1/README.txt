LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018
Lee, Juan
-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned the implementations of NAND and NOR gates within circuits. I also learned how to implement a given truth tables using circuits. I learned how to work with MMLogic and how to create circuits using this software. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
I watched a lot of videos before this lab project so I understood what was going on very well. What I did have issues with was the creation of clean circuits. After finishing my lab project, I realized that it was considered a messy circuit and I had to take time to
Organized every part of the lab. 
 
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I felt as if this assignment wasn't so beginner friendly. Having clear steps on how to work with MMLogic would help in working on this lab.
 
What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
I used youtube to figure out how NAND and NOR works and how I can implement those gates in creating my sum of products for part C. I also used google to search up the equivalents to  and using only NANDs and or using only NANDs. 

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
I worked on this lab alone. I researched any topics that I needed extra help on to solidify my understanding of logic gates for this lab.
