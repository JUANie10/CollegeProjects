To run this script, open up the python script and type your username and password in the boxed section. Make sure to install selenium and chrome webdriver. Run and enjoy :)

This script will output a list of usernames of people that you follow that don't follow you back and also outputs the number of people. 

Pro Tips

1. Make sure you have installed Selenium
2. Make sure your path directory to your chrome webdriver is in the right place after you have downloaded Chrome driver.
3. Do not run this script more than 10 times in one day or else instagram will kick you out of your account
